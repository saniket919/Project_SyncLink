# Project SyncLink
Hi there I am Durgansh Dixit , the developer of this project , here are the features of this project 

1. The Chrome extension would allow users to highlight and copy text from any webpage.

2. The user can then click on the extension icon in their Chrome browser and a pop-up window will appear. This window will have a text box where the user can paste the copied text.

3. The user can then tap a "Send" button, which will send the text to the Android app via Firebase.

4. The Android app will receive the text through Firebase and display a notification to the user.

5. When the user taps on the notification, the Android app will open and display the received text in a text box.

6. The user can then make any desired edits to the text and tap a "Send" button to send the edited text back to the Chrome extension via Firebase.

7. The Chrome extension will receive the edited text through Firebase and automatically paste it into the text box on the pop-up window.

This project would utilize Firebase as a real-time database to facilitate the communication between the Chrome extension and Android app. The Chrome extension would use the Firebase Realtime Database API to send and receive text, while the Android app would use the Firebase Realtime Database API and Firebase Cloud Messaging API to send and receive notifications and text.

Overall, this project would allow users to easily share and edit text between their Chrome browser and Android device.
